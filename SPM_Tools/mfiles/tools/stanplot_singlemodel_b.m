%%%% PLOT OF FMRI CURVES IN SPM5
%%%% Stan Dehaene  April 2009 (based on earlier code in SPM5) 
%%%% Comes with no warranty!!! But pretty nice plots...
%%%%
%%%% EXAMPLES: 
%
% modeldir = '/neurospin/unicog/protocols/IRMf/dyslexie_monzalvo_2007/al080002/stats/LggHRF';
% stanplot_singlemodel(modeldir,1,repmat(1:4,1,5),[-4.8:2.4:14.4],3,[66 -18 9])
%
% To regroup conditions, and eliminate some others (marked as 0):
% stanplot_singlemodel('f:\runAd\stats\statrunad',12,repmat([1 0 1 0 ],1,5),3,[-4:2:30]);
%
%%%%
%%%% This program starts with a simple SPM Model, whose location is given in modeldir.
%%%% - loads the file names in SPM.mat
%%%% - gets the data for a given voxel in the original data files,
%%%% - corrects it according to the model's filter and variables of
%%%% non-interest
%%%% - finds the conditions and their onsets in SPM.mat
%%%% - computes and plots the time-locked averages for the different conditions, grouped according the variable groupvar.
%%%% - also computes the FIR estimate of the deconvolved hemodynamic responses
%%%% 
%%%% Some of the program's nicest features are:
%%%% - it is generic and works with any SPM model with as many runs and
%%%% event onsets as needed.
%%%% - it incorporates all of SPM's whitening, filtering, and regressing out of
%%%% variables of non-interest; all of those undesired effects are removed
%%%% prior to averaging or deconvolving.
%%%% - it works at any desired temporal resolution! The program will
%%%% attempt to estimate the hemodynamic response at the desired time
%%%% points. Of course this will work only if the events are randomly
%%%% jittered with respect to the fMRI acquisition -- but even if this is
%%%% not the case, the program will not crash, but simply report the
%%%% presence of missing points in the final curves.
%%%% - it usually does not crash when the original data have been moved,
%%%% but attempts to retrieve them using the current model path.
%%%%
%%%% The argument modeldir is the name of the directory where the model
%%%% (i.e. SPM.mat) is located).
%%%%
%%%% The argument Finterest (usually = 1) indicates which contrast in the SPM model
%%%% refers to the F test of real interest. This F test usually has ones in columns for all
%%%% variables of interest, and zero everywhere else, e.g. for movement
%%%% regressors whose effects on the data must be subtracted out.
%%%% Specify zero (0) if you have no contrast of interest. However, note
%%%% that your plot may not be as nice as it could be (for instance, the
%%%% effects of movement might be regressed out in the SPM stats, but not
%%%% in your plot).
%%%%
%%%% The argument groupvar is a "remapping" vector which allows you to regroup conditions at will.
%%%% It must be as long as the numbers of
%%%% runs X the numbers of conditions in each run. For each such condition
%%%% declared in the model, groupvar gives the output
%%%% condition. Use zero for conditions that you don't want to see in the
%%%% plot.
%%%% Examples:
%%%% groupvar=ones(1:5*2) will regroup all conditions (of a 5 runs and 2 conds model) into a single output cell
%%%% groupvar = [ 1 2  1 2  1 2  1 2  1 2 ] will regroup these two conditions across all 5 runs
%%%% groupvar = [ 0 1  0 1  0 1  0 0  0 0 ] will discard condition 1 and
%%%% only plot condition 2 for the first 3 runs.
%%%%
%%%% The argument "timeaxis" specifies the time range and resolution of
%%%% the resulting plot, in seconds
%%%% e.g. timeaxis = [-4:1:12] will give you a plot from -4 to 12 seconds,
%%%% with a spacing of 1 second between the successive time points.
%%%%
%%%% The argument "baselinepoints" specifies the number of initial points of the curve that serve as a baseline
%%%% The mean of these points will be subtracted from each curve.
%%%%
%%%% The voxel xyz coordinates in mm can be passed as the last argument
%%%% e.g. [-42 -57 -12 ] for the VWFA
%%%% If they are not passed, then the program attemps to find them from the current cursor location in the
%%%% current SPM figure 1
%%%%
%%%% The output gives the mean and standard error for the actual data (y)
%%%% and the model (Y), separately for event-related averaging and FIR
%%%% estimation.
%%%%
%%%% TIPS:
%%%% - Be aware that event-related averaging often does not provide a satisfactory
%%%% solution. It works really well only for slow-event-related designs
%%%% with non-overlapping events. Nothing will prevent this program from
%%%% running in other cases -- but the results will be meaningless!
%%%% - In general the FIR estimates should therefore be easier to interpret
%%%% as hemodynamic responses. However, they can be poorly estimable, for
%%%% instance if the design is a block design. In general, FIR should work
%%%% best with random fast event-related designs, where conditions are
%%%% ideally uncorrelated. Also, FIR works quite poorly if there is a high
%%%% density of points to be estimated, compared to the number of images.
%%%% It is a good idea to set the resolution to about one TR, and decrease
%%%% this value until the FIR matrix which appears in figure 31 peaks at 1, not 2 or more.
